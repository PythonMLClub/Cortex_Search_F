# Transforming Enterprise Search with AI Using Snowflake CortexÂ Search

Simplifying and safeguarding AI processes is crucial as more businesses use generative AI technologies. A strong, AI-powered tool for examining enormous volumes of both structured and unstructured data inside the Snowflake environment is Snowflake Cortex Search. I utilized a straightforward library book search system with unstructured data as an example to show how Cortex Search can revolutionize search capabilities with AI, while also emphasizing its wider benefits for businesses looking to use AI with robust data governance. Fundamentally, Cortex Search makes use of vector search, which is facilitated by Snowflake's Arctic Embed M model, which is both highly effective and reasonably priced.
<br><br>A hybrid strategy that optimizes result retrieval and ranking by combining lexical search and semantic reranking is added to this vector search.
This group approach makes use of:
<br>
### Semantic similarity using vector search
Vector search comprehends the semantic meaning of searches and retrieves results based on the concepts behind the words, in contrast to traditional methods that depend on the precise match of keywords inside documents.
### Lexical matching through keyword search
In order to guarantee that particular terms from the query show up in the results, keyword search concentrates on exact word matches. When locating papers with specific language or terminology, this method is quite helpful.
### To display the most pertinent results, use semantic reranking.
Semantic reranking rearranges the first results according to how relevant they are to the purpose of the query. This guarantees that the results at the top of the list are the most relevant to the context.
<br>
By using this multi-pronged strategy, Cortex Search can handle a wide variety of queries effectively without extensive tuning.
